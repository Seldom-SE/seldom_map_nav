`seldom_map_nav` is a Bevy plugin that does navmesh generation, pathfinding, and navigation for
tilemaps. Navmesh generation is available without Bevy dependency. It is agnostic to the solution
you use for your tilemaps, but doesn't require much glue. It is also agnostic to your position type,
as long as it implements `Position2` (ex. `Transform`). It's compatible with
[`seldom_state`](https://github.com/Seldom-SE/seldom_state) with the `state` feature.

## Features

- Navmesh generation for finite, square tilemaps
- Awareness of navigator physical size
- Bevy plugin for pathfinding and navigation
- Integration with `seldom_state`

## Future Work

This crate is currently in maintenance mode, so I'm not currently adding new features.

- [ ] Tiles that can be pathed over in certain situations, such as doors
- [ ] Tiles that cannot be pathed over, but do not need clearance generated, such as holes

The generated paths are not always optimal, even with the greatest quality settings,
but I do not plan to fix this myself. If possible, I may switch dependencies to improve this,
though.

## [`seldom_state`](https://github.com/Seldom-SE/seldom_state) Compatibility

If the `state` feature is enabled, it will trigger the `DoneTrigger` when it is done navigating (if
it reaches the destination or cannot find a path).
Also, see related example: `cargo run --example state --features="state"`

## Usage

Add to your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
# Replace * with your desired version
[dependencies]
seldom_map_nav = "*"
```

To generate navmeshes without Bevy integration, disable the `bevy` feature
and use `Navmeshes::generate` or `seldom_map_nav::mesh::generate_navmesh`.
See the `no_bevy.rs` example.

To generate paths without using the built-in navigation, add the `MapNavPlugin` to your app,
add the `Navmeshes` component to your tilemap (or some other entity), and add
the `Pathfind` component to your navigating entity. To use the built-in navigation, also add
the `Nav` component to your navigating entity. See the `nav.rs` example. If you are having trouble
getting it to generate a path, enable the `log` feature, and it might tell you what's wrong.
